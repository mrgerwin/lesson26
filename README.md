Extending the Point of Sale System to a Project

Use your file or the file attached to attend to these enhancement ideas or your own project ideas.

Part 4
Enhancements:
-Implement what happens when the user completes the sale.  Consider making another table that keeps track of all transactions.  It should include the customerID as well as the products purchased, total cost, and the date.
-Add an option where you can update the quantity of the products wanted which will also update the price.  Consider using a dropdown box or slider widget for this.
-Add a rewards program where when you bring up the customer's information it also shows how much the customer has spent at the store this month.

If you have time:
Find a barcode app online.  Print some barcodes that match the ones in your inventory.  Use a barcode scanner to look up the items.

Python is sometimes referred to as the glue that binds programs together.  Explain how Python is the “glue” between the database to the GUI?
